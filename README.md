the Ecommerse System is the main class and the Product class is a spuer class for three subclasses which is, ElectronicProduct , ClothingProduct and BookProduct which inherites the super class
we can make the attributes private or better be protected to be used easily in all the package.
we made an array to input the user's products and sum it in the end with the method totalPrice and if he wants to place the order we display his order's summary with the method Orderinfo which displays the customer's id and each product he chose with its price
we also made a gui system for the project to entertain the user and make the project look better
